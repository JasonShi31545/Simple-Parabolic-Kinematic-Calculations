# PARABOLIC KINEMATIC CALCULATIONS

### Parabolic kinematic calculations is a program which calculates the kinematics of mass launched with initial velocity at a angle.
### __Note: This program shouldn't be used commercially or practically in serious scenarios. This program should only be used as a personal, non-commercial and only for learning, and exploration purposes.__

Parabolic kinematic calculations is suitable for positively launched mass from the 'ground' and landed on the 'ground'. ('Ground' as in y=0)
